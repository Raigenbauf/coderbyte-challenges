Open index.html and follow the links.

Goals in order:
 * Relearn JavaScript by doing challenges (each challenge in own webpage).
 * Relearn and learn JS libraries and frameworks (JQuery).
 * Create a basic static server that makes the pagelayout/UI/UX easier to maintain by having the server slap the boilerplate HTML to the problems. I'll probably have to learn Node.js or ASP or PHP or mess around with that NginX server.
 * Make the site pretty.
